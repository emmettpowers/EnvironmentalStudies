# EnvironmentalStudies
In my environmental studies course at Reed College, I worked on a group project in which we created a 'social vulnerability index' that can be mapped in a GIS program to display a vulnerability score for each neighborhood of Portland. This is a record of the coding I did in R to create the full dataset of variables for our index.
